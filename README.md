The "Eat Safe, Love" project involved the analysis of a UK food hygiene dataset using Python and MongoDB. The dataset contained information on food establishments, including their hygiene scores and ratings. The analysis was performed in several parts, with each part answering a different question related to the dataset.

The exploratory analysis involved answering questions such as which establishments had a hygiene score of 20, which establishments in London had a rating value greater than or equal to 4, and what were the top 5 establishments with a rating value of 5, sorted by the lowest hygiene score. The analysis also involved determining the number of establishments with a hygiene score of 0 in each local authority area.

The analysis showed that the dataset contained a range of information, including the location of food establishments, hygiene scores, and rating values. The results of the analysis provide useful insights into food safety and hygiene in the UK, which can be used by policymakers, health officials, and the public to make informed decisions about where to eat.

if i had more time i would have loved to spend more time learning how to properly import data to MondoDB. I felt that the engine i created was not as consistent in pulling data. An example would be the data pulled would show 900+ on one line and if i reran it the integer would go to 0.
